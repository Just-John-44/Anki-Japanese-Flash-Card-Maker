program flow:
 - read input text file kanji and kiragana/katakana into list of tuples (kanji, hiragana/katakana)
    - initialize card file manager with search directories in config file
 - create a tuple of initialized card objects from words in that list
 - scrape jisho for definition of words in list and add them as sentences to the tuple of cards
   one by one
 - prompt chat gpt for sentence examples from list of words and add them the cards in the cards
   tuple
 - generate tts audio files for each of the words in the words list and add them to the cards in 
   the tuple of cards
 - scan cards for missing data and notify user if there is any
    - if there is missing data as user to fill in data by hand or retry generation for that
      specific piece of data
 - ask user if they want a comma separated list of the words in their original file to insert into
   a pitch accent dictionary sent to them via email
    - if they say yes, prompt user for their email and send them the list
    - start prompting user for pitch accent for each card in the tuple of cards and modify hiragana/
      katakana card attributes accordingly
 - print all cards in a readable manner
 - all cards should be complete now and the user should be asked if they want their deck 
   created
    - if yes, export card audio to correct anki folder and create file in the user's desired
      directory
 - end
